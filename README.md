An end-to-end solution to consistently identify soccer players across two camera feeds (“broadcast” and “tacticam”) using:

1. **Object Detection & Tracking** (YOLOv11 + DeepSORT)  
2. **Appearance Feature Extraction** (OSNet-AIN person ReID)  
3. **Cross-Camera Matching** (cosine similarity + Hungarian algorithm)
